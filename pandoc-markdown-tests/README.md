Pandoc Markdown Tests
=====================

This is a whole pile of random scripts that I'm using to figure out behaviour of
what pandoc does in different circumstances with translating between
Markdown/JSON/HTML/LaTeX.

Some of these are about trying to figure out what gets rendered in various
formats, what gets put into the Pandoc JSON AST when you use different
inputs/outputs, and just trying to see how everything works.

This originally used the system install of `pandoc`, but I've changed it to use
[pandocker].
