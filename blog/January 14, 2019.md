Today I've finished collecting learning outcomes from [Jim Young's "Learn to
Program" textbook].

The process of getting learning outcomes from this document was pretty
straightforward because each unit of the book starts out with a list of the
learning outcomes that should be able to be accomplished by the end of the unit.

I think that, for the most part, the learning outcomes listed at the beginning
of the units accurately represented the material that a student should expect to
be able to do by the end of the unit. That said, I did a few things with the
learning outcomes that I collected:

1. Annotated, where appropriate, learning outcomes that are strictly related to
   the Processing environment and do not generally apply to "programming".
2. Added learning outcomes that might more generally reflect what the unit is
   trying to accomplish.
3. Added learning outcomes that are implied and not explicitly stated in the
   unit.
   
The first place to look for course material, I think, is the instructor schedule
that Heather shared with me. The schedule lists the expected learning outcomes
for each week of the course.
