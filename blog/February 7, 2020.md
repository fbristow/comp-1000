I'm going through *an* MIT course right now. The course is significantly
different from ours, but I don't find the fact surprising. The course spends
very little time talking about basic programming ideas, moving through
statements, conditional statements, loops, and functions within the first few
classes. By the end of the first unit (I don't have a sense of how long a unit
goes on for, but I'm guessing it's about a third of a term), they're looking at
complexity, then sorting algorithms.

In terms of "how does this influence how I direct my course?": I feel like this
gives evidence that students *don't* need to spend 3+ months on the *really*
basic programming concepts.
