What am I trying to do right now?

I'm trying to figure out how to do two separate things:

1. How do I collect learning objectives into a `dict` that's keyed on the main
   learning objective's tag?

   This one I think is actually fairly easy, given the script that I've got
   written below -- instead of using a counter, just use a plain `dict` with
   values being `list`s of learning objectives.

   The problem with this is that you lose context of where the objective came
   from.
2. How do I automate numbering learning objectives so that I can refer to them
   across documents?

   When I generate the learning objectives and outcomes for the new course(s) I
   want to be able to say "this objective came from this course", and basically
   be able to do set arithmetic on the objectives to answer questions like
   "Which learning objectives *aren't* being covered?"

   I think to *actually* be able to do this, I might need to *actually* write
   specific labels for everything, which will be tedious and frustrating.
