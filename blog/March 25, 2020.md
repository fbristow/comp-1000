Today's goals:

* [X] Update the `pandoc` filter to collect all the learning objectives in a
      course, then dump them all out at the end under headings for each
      course-level learning outcome.
* [X] Update the `pandoc` filter to add a *colour* to each course-level learning
      outcome, then highlight them in the document wherever they appear. Use
      something like the HTML colour palette for high contrast.

Some showerthought ideas I had yesterday included having something like a colour
thing on the right side of the screen that shows (using the aforementioned
colours) how the course focus flows through the chapters. Of course, that might
be a harder pull to figure out how to do. Maybe a fun diversion into d3 or
something?
