Goals for today:

* [X] Use colours in the LaTeX output, too.
* [ ] Look into the showerthought idea of putting a colour line in the
      curriculum document to visualize how the course units flow through course
      outcomes.
* [ ] Manually tag all course objectives so that you can make references across
      documents.
    * [ ] Figure out what the best tagging approach is (pure LaTeX?)
