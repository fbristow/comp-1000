Goals for today:

* [X] Use colours in the LaTeX output, too.
* [X] Look into the showerthought idea of putting a colour line in the
      curriculum document to visualize how the course units flow through course
      outcomes. I don't think this is realistically doable with 
* [.] Manually tag all course objectives so that you can make references across
      documents.
    * [X] Figure out what the best tagging approach is (pure LaTeX?)
        * Pure LaTeX doesn't really do what I want. I can use Pandoc's native
          `span` to give a block of text an ID (e.g., `[outcome]{#id}`), and I
          might wind up doing that anyway, but for now I'm going with a custom
          approach of putting a label in the tag (e.g., `:tag#label`).
    * [ ] Label COMP1010
    * [ ] Label COMP1020
    * [ ] Label COMP1500
