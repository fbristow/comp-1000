I got in touch with Heather to get some sample assignments and tests for COMP
1010 (not reproduced here). I'm going to use these assessments to figure out if
I'm missing any key outcomes/objectives for COMP 1010. I have similar artifacts
for COMP 1012 and COMP 1020 in my own repositories.

I started working on extracting outcomes for COMP 1500 from my own offering of
the course in fall 2017. Thankfully, I spent time writing learning objectives in
lesson plans, so the process is moving along fairly well.
