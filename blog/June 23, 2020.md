Things for today:

* [ ] Get the document ready to share.
    * [ ] Separate 1000.2.1 into multiple subsections, this is the "do real
          programming section". In 1020 I separated this into units.
        * [ ] Separate into sections
    * [ ] Flesh out "Ideas for instruction" in all units, or remove it.
    * [ ] Confirm that you're OK with all missing outcomes.

I spent *way* more time today trying to figure out how to get the `nameref.py`
script to do "recursive" referencing, but I feel like it's in a place where it
works the way I want it to work. This script has a lot of state and special
cases that it deals with:

1. An outcome that it needs to copy.
2. A reference that's added to a copied outcome.
3. A reference that's been added by an outcome that was copied.
4. A reference that's added to a hard-coded outcome.

I found bugs in the little function I wrote to copy elements (they were left
dangling with no parent document, but I was able to resolve that).

I have not yet finished inserting the outcomes that I had written out yesterday.
