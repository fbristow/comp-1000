I've extracted what I consider to be outcomes from the assignment package that
Heather provided for COMP 1010. At this point, while preliminary, I would
consider the outcomes that I've listed for COMP 1010 to be complete. I think
that the learning outcomes in some cases can be condensed or clarified, but I
want/need to move forward with other courses. Condensing or clarifying learning
outcomes can be part of the critical assessment of learning outcomes.
