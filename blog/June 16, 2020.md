Things for today:

* [X] When doing referencing, I should copy the enclosing `li`, not the `span`
      itself.
* [ ] Get the document ready to share.
    * [ ] Use the right kind of list items in all sections. At some point I
          started using `*` instead of numbers.
    * [ ] Separate 1000.2.1 into multiple subsections, this is the "do real
          programming section". In 1020 I separated this into units.
    * [ ] Flesh out "Ideas for instruction" in all units, or remove it.
* [ ] Build a Python module with supplementary panflute utilities.

I think I need to extract some of the functionality that I've built into my
scripts into a module of helpers for panflute.

Something really weird is happening with the linking stuff: The `pf.Space` is
being added properly, but then the `pf.Link` that **immediately** follows it
isn't getting put in at all. Putting the link construction on its own line
causes it to magically work???????

The statement was split across two lines, but I don't fully understand why that
would cause it to silently fail. For now I'm going to mark it up as magic and
accept it. I might dig into it more tomorrow.
