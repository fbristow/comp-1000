Goals for today:

* [ ] Capture which learning outcomes are *not* included in the new course.
* [ ] Simplify the `Makefile`, it's pretty messy right now and I think can be
      simplified now that I'm pretty much doing all courses the same way.
* [X] Get the approximately equal to to use `&asymp;` in HTML output and
      `\approx` in LaTeX.

Using the right symbol in both LaTeX and HTML is gold plating, but it feels
nicer either way.
