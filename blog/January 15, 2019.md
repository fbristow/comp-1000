Today I started working on COMP 1020. The exercise of extracting outcomes from
the 1020 material is a bit more difficult than from Jim's book -- I've got
week-level objectives, but need to extract granular outcomes from slides.

The first week of COMP 1020 was primarily review/translation from
Python/Processing to Java. The second week is an introduction to OO, how to
represent information.

I also got in touch with David Scuse and got a PDF copy of Growing Algorithms
and Data Structures, which I will use as an additional source of information
going forward.
