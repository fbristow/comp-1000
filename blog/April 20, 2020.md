Goals for today:

* [X] Deal with duplicate IDs and outcome tags for COMP 1020. (Unfortunately I
      made this hard on myself and this will apply to literally every learning
      objective...)
* [X] Prepare a pipeline that will merge the three courses into a single
      document.
    * [X] Get the group by outcome part into the pipeline
    * [X] Add more colours so that we can include COMP 1500.
* [ ] Start using the `\nameref` idea to put learning objectives into a new
      course.

I added 3 more colours. Ideally I'd come up with some way to generate colour
pairs, but that's going down a rabbit hole...

---

Adding the group by outcome was trivial -- add it to the pandoc command
importing the course. The main issue with it is that it's **slow**! Doing a
`copy.deepcopy` on the objects is copying a *lot* I'm guessing.

---

Starting on the multi-IDs in COMP1020, the decision I'm making with regard to
choosing between OO and program is that things that are *specific* to Java's
implementation of OO are programming related.

Done. Some of the "subobjectives" don't have tags, but I think I will re-address
those when I actually start looking at the next course.
