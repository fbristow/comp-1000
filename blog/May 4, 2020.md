To do:

* [ ] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.
* [X] Fix the `Makefile`... :(

At some point during my simplification of the `Makefile`, I broke the tags, so
the tagged outcomes don't show up anymore, even though the colours still show
up. This *only* seems to affect COMP 1000 -- all of the individual courses still
seem to work. Looks like I changed the order of the scripts. These are
*fragile*! That was definitely the problem!

Before I get in touch with the instructors, I think I want to do a quick review
of 1020. I *may* want to change the first unit into what the expectations are
from that unit instead of just saying that it's 2 weeks long.

In the ongoing saga of doing stuff that isn't *directly* related to what I'm
supposed to be doing, I found something that *looks* like a bug in `pandoc`. I
submitted a [bug report], but the author pointed me at a [different report]
where the feature was introduced. As I noted in the thread, what I'm really
looking for is a way to have an unlisted appendix at the end of the document.
