To do:

* [ ] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.
* [X] Fix the `Makefile`... :(

At some point during my simplification of the `Makefile`, I broke the tags, so
the tagged outcomes don't show up anymore, even though the colours still show
up. This *only* seems to affect COMP 1000 -- all of the individual courses still
seem to work. Looks like I changed the order of the scripts. These are
*fragile*! That was definitely the problem!
