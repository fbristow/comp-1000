Things for today:

* [ ] Fix the objective barcode so that it will build an objective barcode *per
      course* in the giant comp1000 file.
* [X] Figure out if I can do *anything* about Appendices between HTML and PDF.
* [ ] Try to figure out how to get section numbering working correctly in the
      giant merged document with appendices (or how to selectively turn it off).

~~I don't know if there's any reasonable way for me to get a header to appear in
the HTML document *and* have it appear in the TOC without it appearing in other
outputs. My solution to this problem is to add to add a filter that only adds~~

My `Makefile` has two separate targets for COMP 1000, and since this is the only
course I need to care about the appendix stuff in, I'm just going to create two
separate files that get added on to the end of the document, one for `tex` and
one for `md`/`html`. That's way simpler than writing a custom filter to do this.
