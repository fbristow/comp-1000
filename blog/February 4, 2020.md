After having spent some time migrating the learning outcomes into the database,
I think I'm going to stop doing that for now. The process is overly complicated
for what I'm really trying to do right now, which is:

1. Evaluate the learning outcomes in our current courses, and
2. Organize the learning outcomes into some logical structure that *isn't* a
   schedule.
   
So I'm going to stop working on that, possibly revisiting it in the future.

Looking at what I originally planned to do, the next step is actually to
evaluate what *other* institutions cover as part of their own curriculum.

I was recommended to look at the ACM curriculums for CS0, CS1, and CS2. The
spirit of CS0 corresponds most closely with COMP 1500, but I can't find a clear
definition of CS0 on the ACM web site. The curricula for CS1  seem to correspond
most closely with COMP 1010 (programming first).
