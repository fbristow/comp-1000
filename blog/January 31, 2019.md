I'm in the process of transferring the learning outcomes that I extracted from
COMP 1010 material into a [GNU recutils] database.

I'm trying to add a bit of structure to the comprehensive listing of learning
outcomes that I got from course materials, but I'm going back and forth on how
useful the exercise actually is.

On one hand, I'll be able to (possibly) show linkages between learning outcomes
between courses. On the other hand, plain-text or not, this format doesn't lend
itself well to other people actually maintaining it.

That said, I can't think of a better way to represent this information other
than in a structured way. YAML, maybe? SQLite? JSON?
