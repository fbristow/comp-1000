Small break, went to Toronto.

Making progress on re-evaluating learning objectives for COMP 1010. I wrote a
pandoc filter to collect all of the vimwiki-style tags that I'm adding to each
of the individual learning outcomes, and I'm starting to feel happy with the way
that the tags look. I'm pleased that I can use pandoc and pandoc filters to
*effectively* provide me with a text-parsing engine.

After I finish 1010, I'll move on to 1020, then I think I'll start working on
the outcomes for the new course.
