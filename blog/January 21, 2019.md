I fairly rapidly went through outcomes for COMP 1012, primarily because I'd
created a schedule with outcomes for the last time I taught it.

The next steps are to:

1. Collect outcomes from COMP 1500
2. Review learning outcomes for COMP 1010, COMP 1020, and COMP 1012 considering
   assessment methods.
