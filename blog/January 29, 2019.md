Today I've started writing learning outcomes into a database to help organize
them a bit better. My process right now is to take the raw outcomes that I
identified from the textbook for COMP 1010 and try to simplify them into fewer
outcomes, where appropriate (i.e., create, then initialize, then use a variable
becomes one outcome where it was 3 when I extracted them).
