Things for today:

* [.] Get the document ready to share.
    * [X] Use the right kind of list items in all sections. At some point I
          started using `*` instead of numbers.
    * [.] Separate 1000.2.1 into multiple subsections, this is the "do real
          programming section". In 1020 I separated this into units.
        * [X] Add IDs to COMP 1020 in the separated out sections.
        * [ ] Add equivalencies in 1020 from 1010.
            * [ ] Fix the script that adds the equivalencies.
    * [ ] Flesh out "Ideas for instruction" in all units, or remove it.
    * [ ] Confirm that you're OK with all missing outcomes.
* [ ] Build a Python module with supplementary panflute utilities.
* [ ] The Python scripts are painfully slow. Make them faster.

Now that I'm actually looking at the giant list of topics in the review section,
I feel like I need to go back to COMP 1020 and actually add IDs to all of the
objectives that I wrote there. I should maybe also, then, add the equivalent
objectives from COMP 1010.

I tried just adding the equivalencies into my 1020 document, but, of course, it
didn't work. I wanted to try adding in *just* the `=` or `~` equivalencies to a
hand-written outcome, but the way I've written the `nameref.py` script is
expecting there to be a previously found "target" `*` reference. If I want that
to work, I'm going to have to modify that script.
