I'm thinking that, going forward, as I write new learning objectives/outcomes
for courses, I should just keep the same format as I have been (writing in raw
`:outcome#id:`). The converter that I wrote can be used as an intermediate
output in a pipeline of files. That means that I wouldn't have to use the overly
verbose `span` syntax, but the downstream parsers (adding colours and stuff) can
rely on a more structured input.

Goals for proceeding:

* [ ] Deal with duplicate IDs and outcome tags for COMP 1020. (Unfortunately I
      made this hard on myself and this will apply to literally every learning
      objective...)
* [X] Deal with duplicate IDs in COMP 1500. (there's only one duplicate ID)
* [ ] Rewrite the colouring script to use the more structured input provided by
      the native spans and attributes.
* [ ] Prepare a pipeline that will merge the three courses into a single
      document.
* [ ] Start using the `\nameref` idea to put learning objectives into a new
      course.
