Goals for today:

* [X] Capture which learning outcomes are *not* included in the new course.
* [ ] Simplify the `Makefile`, it's pretty messy right now and I think can be
      simplified now that I'm pretty much doing all courses the same way.
* [ ] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.

Making good progress on the missing learning objective stuff:

* The course headings are inserted into the right place,
* The unit headings are inserted into the right place,
* I've got a handle on the learning objectives themselves.

The mistake(?) that I made is when collecting the objectives: I'm collecting
instances of `pf.Span` and not `pf.ListItem`. Getting the `pf.ListItem` *might*
be as trivial as using something like `ancestor(2)`. It was! Nice!

I mentioned before about the units being in some weird order. At first I thought
that wouldn't be a serious issue, but now that I can actually see it, it's
pretty annoying.

I'm *pretty* sure that the random ordering happens when I do set arithmetic on
the IDs. Let's check and see if all of the IDs that I collected are in order.
They are indeed. Instead of doing set arithmetic, I could just *manually* do the
arithmetic (e.g., test to see if the `id` is `not in` the referenced set). Not
very elegant, but...

That works, but the problem is that with the structure I've set up, I can only
ask if the `id` is `not in` the referenced set *after* I've already put the
header into the document. A solution to this problem is to build up the entire
unit/section, then insert it all in one go in the end after we've figured out
that there are (or are not) items to insert into the `pf.OrderedList`.

That worked, and was less difficult than expected, since I was already building
the `pf.OrderedList` before inserting it into the document. Nice!
