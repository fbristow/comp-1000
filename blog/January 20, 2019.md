I've finished going through the lecture notes for COMP 1020 for the fall 2019
term.

The bulk of the material for COMP 1020 seems to fit into two main categories:

1. Review of COMP 1010 concepts
2. Java-specific programming practice problems
3. Brief introduction to or survey of 2nd year concepts (2140, 2150)

I need to still go through the evaluation material to make sure that I've got
the right set of outcomes for this course, same for COMP 1010, but now that I've
got a preliminary list of outcomes I've got something to work with.
