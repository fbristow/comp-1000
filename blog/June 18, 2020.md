Things for today:

* [.] Get the document ready to share.
    * [.] Separate 1000.2.1 into multiple subsections, this is the "do real
          programming section". In 1020 I separated this into units.
        * [ ] Separate into sections
        * [o] Add equivalencies in 1020 from 1010.
            * [ ] Add the equivalencies. 
            * [X] Fix the script that adds the equivalencies.
    * [ ] Flesh out "Ideas for instruction" in all units, or remove it.
    * [ ] Confirm that you're OK with all missing outcomes.
* [ ] Build a Python module with supplementary panflute utilities.
* [ ] The Python scripts are painfully slow. Make them faster.

Thinking on the slow scripts thing, the slowness is definitely related to deep
copying elements. I get the feeling that the slowness might be related to the
property of a `pf.Element` having a reference to `doc`?
