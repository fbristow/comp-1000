Goals for today:

* [X] Show which course a learning outcome refers to.
* [ ] Think about how to do *equivalencies* (i.e., if a learning objective from
      COMP 1010 and COMP 1500 are effectively equivalent, how do I represent
      that?).
* [ ] Capture which learning outcomes are *not* included in the new course.
* [ ] Get the colouring to work on the COMP 1000 course outcomes, too.

The `\nameref` idea is working fairly nicely. The main drawback (beyond the
linking thing that I want to be able to do) is that there's no context in terms
of which course a learning objective came from. I need to go back and, I think
in `tags-to-attr.py`, add a "course" attribute, then I can use that attribute in
`\nameref`.

I also included the outcome, but I think I need to rethink the `nameref.py`
thing -- right now it `pf.stringify`s the learning outcome. Should I just
*duplicate* it instead? Something else?

The COMP 1000 outcomes and objectives don't get coloured in the same way as the
other courses for the reason above: the `tags-to-attr.py` script isn't run on it
first. I tried running it blindly, but running the file with `\nameref` through
`pandoc` causes `pandoc` to render the `\nameref` instances as LaTeX blocks,
making it so that I can't just look for instances of `pf.RawBlock` or
`pf.RawInline`. I'm wondering if I should just make my own custom syntax.
