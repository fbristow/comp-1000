To do:

* [X] Fill in the learning objectives for the intro unit to 1020.
* [ ] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.

I want to fill in the learning objectives for 

    Write and run a program in a new programming language (Java), transferring
    skills learned in previous courses (Python or Processing). 1 :program:

from COMP 1020 before sending out an e-mail to the 2nd year instructors.

That's done! The unit was *very* long, especially since it's pretty much 2 weeks
of content.

I had to figure a few things out along the way:

1. I'm using/abusing section numbers so that units have the form of "Unit
   1020.1" to say "Unit 1 of COMP 1020". The length of those section numbers are
   *crazy*, and not normally expected, so I had to figure out which package to
   use to change the way the TOC looks in LaTeX.
2. I had to futz with `colour.py` and `group-by-outcome.py` to work with
   learning objectives with *just* tags and no IDs because I wanted all of the
   review objectives in 1020 to be treated like other objectives, but I don't
   want to be able to refer to them later by ID.
3. I *tried* to get similar output to HTML with PDF in terms of the "barcode" of
   objectives, but my LaTeX-fu is just not up to snuff.
