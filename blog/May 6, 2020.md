To do:

* [o] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.
    * [X] COMP 2140
    * [X] ~~COMP 2160~~
    * [X] COMP 2150
    * [ ] COMP 2280
    * [ ] COMP 2080

I spent some time working on the "course barcode" output with LaTeX. I wasn't
satisfied with the way that it looked using plain `\colorbox`, so I rewrote some
stuff using `tcolorbox` and it much more closely resembles the HTML output and
I'm much happier with the way it looks.

I'm going to do a final review of the objectives for 1020, then send e-mails to
2nd year instructors.

I've spent some time making the document *look* pretty, without significant
change to the content, so I need to actually send the document out.

I sent an e-mail to COMP 2140. *I am* COMP 2160 (for now, anyway), so I'm not
sending an e-mail to that instructor.

I've also sent to COMP 2150. I think I'll stick to this for today, and see what
feedback I get from those people.
