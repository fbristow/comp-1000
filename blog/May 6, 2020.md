To do:

* [ ] Get in contact with COMP 2XXX instructors to find out their expectations
      for students coming out of COMP 1020 to ensure that the course I design
      meets those expectations.
    * [ ] COMP 2140
    * [ ] COMP 2160
    * [ ] COMP 2150
    * [ ] COMP 2280
    * [ ] COMP 2080

I spent some time working on the "course barcode" output with LaTeX. I wasn't
satisfied with the way that it looked using plain `\colorbox`, so I rewrote some
stuff using `tcolorbox` and it much more closely resembles the HTML output and
I'm much happier with the way it looks.

I'm going to do a final review of the objectives for 1020, then send e-mails to
2nd year instructors.
