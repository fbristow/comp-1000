I've finished going through COMP 1500 and extracting outcomes. At the beginning
of the course (when I offered it), I was disciplined about writing formal
outcomes in my plan, but I stopped as the course went on and had to figure out
what my outcomes were from my own slides.

After having gone through the outcomes from the course that I offered, I feel
optimistic about my overall plan: be able to collapse COMP 10{1,2}0 and COMP
1500 into a two courses instead of three. I'm *not* confident that I can include
COMP 1012 in that -- while COMP 1010 and COMP 1012 share a significant amount of
overlap, the intended application of the outcomes from those courses is entirely
different: 

* COMP 1010 is intended to prepare students going into computer science about
  how to program where programming a building block to bigger ideas.
* COMP 1012 is intended to prepare students going into engineering or other
  science disciplines how to program with the intention of using programming as
  a tool to solve problems given the data that they have (arithmetic, calculus,
  data analysis, etc.), with no clear intentions of building bigger ideas.
  
I perceive COMP 1012 as a course in how to write scripts to solve data analysis
problems where COMP 1010 is an entry into computer science.
