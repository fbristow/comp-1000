I'm still going through MIT course outcomes, but it's starting to feel painful.
I'm going to stop after this unit (Memory and Search Methods), and work on
something else.

I was recommended to, in addition to listing learning objectives for COMP 1010
and COMP 1020 as they are now, provide a recommendation to the curriculum
committee about how I would proceed with updating the courses.

I think in broad terms, that means a few things:

1. COMP 1010 takes a breadth-first approach as opposed to programming-first.
2. COMP 1010 *still includes programming* as a learning outcome for the course,
   but is limited to a visual language.
3. COMP 1020 drops chunks of material with the intention of moving some
   programming concepts from 1010 into 1020, but also to replace with more
   meaningful outcomes considering what's currently in second year:
    1. Significant review at the beginning of the course is dropped or is
       replaced with material that could be considered missing from COMP 1010 as
       updated (text-based programming!).
    2. Objects and OO are limited to heterogeneous data representation
       mechanisms, deferring extensive OO to 2150.
    3. Grab bag 'o stuff: Files & I/O? Error handling/Exceptions?
       Multidimensional arrays?

I got a BBC micro:bit from Erica Hoiss of Kids Code Jeunesse when she came to do
an event here. As I'm looking at the ecosystem, this is easily a device that
students could take with them from COMP 1010 (MakeCode editor, visual language +
JavaScript) to COMP 1020 (Python) to COMP 2160 (C) to COMP 2280 (ARM assembly).

Apparently ARM is a no-go for 2280 because of the need to use a C compiler to
generate ARM binaries, you need to hook in to a lot of stuff to get the C
compiler to generate a binary from asm.
