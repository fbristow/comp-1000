Identify our existing course learning objectives
================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-01-24 Fri>

My first goal is to figure out what, exactly, we're teaching in current first
year courses. I've only taught 3/5 of these courses, and one of those was an
online version of the course that's probably really out of date.

This goal is really what I consider to be my minimal success criteria in
terms of our department gaining something from my work.

COMP 1010
---------

Where can I get information for this course?

Identify course learning objectives for *other* institutions
============================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-02-21 Fri>

We've got our own internal, current goals for courses in the first year. What
do other institutions do? Domestic institutions? Different levels/kinds (high
school, college, university)? International? Having an idea of what's the
"best practice" in current introductory CS education might be helpful in
informing what we're doing internally.

Critically assess learning objectives
=====================================

DEADLINE: <2020-03-06 Fri>

Does what we're currently teaching in our first year computer science courses
make sense? Does it make sense in terms of...

- what other institutions are doing?
- what students know coming in to the program?

Can what we're currently teaching be improved? Focused?

Construct a new course, considering critical assessment
=======================================================

Create list of course objectives
--------------------------------

Create course learning outcomes
-------------------------------

Create course material for learning outcomes/objectives

Create lab exercises
--------------------

Do we even *need*  lab exercises?
