* TODO Identify our existing course learning objectives

My first goal is to figure out what, exactly, we're teaching in current first
year courses. I've only taught 3/5 of these courses, and one of those was an
online version of the course that's probably really out of date.

This goal is really what I consider to be my minimal success criteria in
terms of our department gaining something from my work.

* TODO Identify course learning objectives for *other* institutions

We've got our own internal, current goals for courses in the first year. What
do other institutions do? Domestic institutions? Different levels/kinds (high
school, college, university)? International? Having an idea of what's the
"best practice" in current introductory CS education might be helpful in
informing what we're doing internally.

* TODO Critically assess learning objectives
