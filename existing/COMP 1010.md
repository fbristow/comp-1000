Learning outcomes
-----------------

The following sections of learning outcomes are extracted verbatim from [Jim's
online textbook].

[Jim's online textbook]:
https://cs.umanitoba.ca/~young/learnToProgram/LTP/LTP-AllUnits.pdf

### Unit 1

* Explain to a layperson what computer programming is
* Calculate how many operations a computer can perform each second based on its
  specifications

### Unit 2

* Choose and set the canvas size for your programs. :processing:
* Set the location where shapes are drawn on the canvas. :processing:
* Set the background, outline, and fill colors of your canvas and shapes.
  :processing:
* Draw lines, circles, ellipses, triangles, and points. :processing:
* Insert in-line and block comments to describe your program.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Write a simple program.
* Run a simple program.

### Unit 3

* Create a new integer variable and give it a unique name.
* Store information into a variable (e.g., the number 10).
* Get information out of a variable. :ambiguous:
* Create a variable and give it an initial value in one line of code.
* Create multiple variables in one line of code.
* Add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers.
* Get the remainder when dividing two integers.
* Apply order of operations to figure out the result of a calculation.
  :prerequisite: :high-school:
* Use the built-in `println` command to look inside variables for investigating
  your errors. :processing:
  
What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Debug simple errors by inspecting the value of variables.
* Use a variable in an expression.
* Use arithmetic operators in an expression (add, subtract, multiply, divide,
  modulus).
* Explain the purpose of the modulus operator.

### Unit 4

* Choose meaningful variable names that make your code more readable.
* Create *named constants* that cannot change once set, as a safety feature.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Explain how named constants can be used as a safety feature.
* Identify values that should be represented as a named constant.
* Use named constants in a program.

### Unit 5

* Create an active program that can change while it is running. :processing:
* Create animations where the drawing changes as time passes. :processing:
* Use the mouse location as input to your program. :processing:
* Calculate which of two numbers is larger or smaller. 

**Note**: An "active program" here is **not** loop structures. Instead, we're
using features of Processing. Processing *itself* has a timer that calls
functions with specific names repeatedly. The students are not aware that a loop
is being used behind the scenes here. Note also that the outcome "Calculate..."
is not covered in the text of this unit.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Use a "global variable" in a program to maintain state across function calls.
* List the *special* function names that are used in Processing. :processing:
* Explain the purpose of the special function names used in Processing.
  :processing:
* Explain the order of operations in the execution of a Processing program
  (which functions get run in what order, when global variables are initialized,
  etc.). :processing:

### Unit 6

* Create your own user-defined functions.
* Use your custom functions within other functions.
* Use your custom functions to avoid repeating code.
* Apply the top-down technique to solve problems.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Explain what happens when a function is called/describe or explain how code
  flows when a statement is reached that calls a function.
* Define the term "scope" in terms of variable visibility when declared *within*
  a function.
* Determine the visibility of a variable declared in a program.
* Define the term "local variable".

### Unit 7

* Create variables to store real numbers.
* Work with real numbers, e.g., do basic math operations.
* Do basic trigonometry to help with graphical calculations. :prerequisite:
  :high-school:
* Use shortcuts for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
  :ambiguous:
* Get the canvas size from new global variables. :processing:

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Use real numbers in an expression.
* Explain the difference between integers and real numbers.
* Determine if the result of an expression is an integer or a real number.
* Use built-in trigonometry functions in an expression.
* Explain how floating point numbers are limited in a computer program.
* Use compound assignment/arithmetic operators (i.e., `+=`, `++`).

### Unit 8

* Create variables to store text data, called `String`s.
* Combine multiple `String`s together.
* Convert between `String`s and numerical data.
* Get the length of a `String`, as an integer.
* Create a character variable.
* Get a specific character out of a `String`, from a specific index.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Explain what the empty `String` is.
* Draw text on the canvas. :processing:
* Explain why number types cannot be assigned to `String` types, and vice-versa.
* Explain how numbering starts with indexes (at 0).
* Use `String` methods.
* Call *methods* on an **object**.

### Unit 9

* Make integer or floating point variables that use more or less memory.
  :abiguous:
* Convert between data types using explicit and implicit casts.

**Note**: section 9.2 is marked as "Advanced" and explains bits and bytes at a
low(er) level, an introduction to number systems. Includes the definition of a
bit, nibble, byte, then explains prefixes (mega, giga, tera).

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate integer overflow.
* Choose an appropriate number type to represent a value.
* Explain why explicit casting is required.
* Explain what happens to numeric data when explicit casting is applied.

### Unit 10

* Create boolean variables and store `true` and `false` in them.
* Use boolean variables in `if` statements to have conditional programs: actions
  that depend on a boolean test.
* Use `else` blocks to have code run when a condition is not true.
* Perform basic boolean operations, the `not`, `and`, and `or` operations.
* Use nested `if` statements, when one conditional is inside another.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Use global variables `mousePressed` and `keyPressed` to inspect state.
  :processing:
* Evaluate logical expressions.
* Explain how variable scope is affected by nested blocks.

### Unit 11

* Compare numerical values, and see if they are equal, or if one is larger than
  the other.
* Compare booleans to see if they are equal.
* Combine boolean and relational operations to complete complex tasks.
* Compare `String` data, to see if two strings are equal.
* Construct if-else-if chains.

What might be missing, or more general learning outcomes:

* Explain why using relational operators on boolean types is discouraged.
  Specifically, why you should prefer `if(x)` instead of `if(x == true)`.
* Explain why floating point numbers should not be compared for equality using
  relational operators.
* Explain how logical expressions can be "short-circuit"ed.
* Use short-circuit expressions in a program.
* Explain why `if` statements without curly braces should be avoided.

### Unit 12

* Create a `for` loop to repeat an operation on a fixed number of items.
* Create a `while` loop to repeat an operation while some condition is true.
