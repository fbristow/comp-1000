Course objectives
-----------------

Course objectives from distance section:

* Apply programming techniques learned in COMP 1010 to newer and larger
  problems.
* Use classes and objects effectively.
* Write software that deals with large sets of data using files stored on disk.
* Create and use collections of data, with an emphasis on the use of classes.
* Solve problems using related classes (inheritance).
* Apply common algorithms, such as searching and sorting, to collections.
* Formulate recursive solutions to problems, and write recursive
  (self-referential) methods.
* Use data structures other than arrays (such as 2D arrays and linked lists).
* Recognize when alternate data structures are appropriate to certain kinds of
  problems.
* Compare the efficiencies of different algorithms used to solve similar
  problems.

Learning outcomes

### Week 1 & 2: Course introduction, real Java

**Note**: Most of this week's content is reviewing content from 1010, and/or
translating Python concepts into Java for 1012 students. I wonder how many
students are enrolled in 1020 from 1012, and if the outcomes listed here are
disproportionately large for the number of students that actually need this as
"new" material.

  ({Processing,Python} => Java).
