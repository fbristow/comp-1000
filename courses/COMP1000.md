Course prerequisites {-}
====================

Before entering this course, a students should be able to:

* Evaluate arithmetic expressions, applying the rules of order of operation to
  basic arithmetic operators (&plus;, &minus;, &times;, &divide;).

Importantly: students are *not* expected to have any previous programming
experience.

Course outcomes {-}
===============

Part 1: Computing
------

By the end of part 1 of this course, a student should be able to:

1. Represent basic information and ideas abstractly, and digitally. :represent:
2. Use and evaluate computational ideas from first-principles (logic &rarr;
   circuits &rarr; processors & computers). :first-principles:
3. Implement abstractions as software (assembly language, visual language).
   :program:
4. Use and evaluate searching algorithms. :algorithms:
5. Gain a better understanding of computer science as a discipline. :concepts:

Part 2: Programming
------

By the end of part 2 of this course, a student should be able to:

1. Transfer programming skills to a new programming language. :program:
2. Use and implement data structures to represent complex information.
   :data-structures:
3. Write code that can handle failures gracefully. :exceptions:
4. Apply searching and sorting algorithms to collections, compare efficiency.
   :algorithms:
5. Formulate recursive solutions to problems and write recursive methods.

Part 1: Computing
------

### Computer science: what even is it? (0.5 weeks)

Before you start looking at how to apply concepts from computer science using
computers, you should get a more holistic idea of computer science by surveying
the disciplines *within* computer science.

Recommended ideas for instruction:

1. Approachable problems and problem descriptions that require *no* knowledge of
   computer science, and no use of computers on the part of the student.
2. Visits by grad students: A day in the life.
3. Visits by co-op students: Where have they worked? Where do they want to work?
4. Visits by faculty: What do they study? How do they study that?

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. List and describe at least 2 different subdisciplines of computer science
   (name of subdiscipline, what the subdiscipline studies, how it studies
   that). :concepts:
2. Approach upper-year and grad students either directly or through student
   clubs for guidance. :concepts:

### What even is a computer? (0.5 weeks)

Now that you have an idea of what computer science is, and who computer
scientists are, we need to spend a little bit of time getting on the same page
about what we mean by "computer".

In this unit, we'll spend some time looking at the etymology of the word
"computer" and how the meaning of the word has changed over the last century.

We're also going to try to put together a list of things that a computer is
capable of computing.

Recommended ideas for instruction:

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. List and explain at least two different interpretations of the word
   "computer".  :concepts:
2. Give an example of a problem that a computer is capable of solving.
   :concepts:
3. Give an example of a problem that a computer is **not** capable of solving.
   :concepts:

### How do you represent *stuff*?

We've learned that computers aren't really very smart, but when we consider the
things that computers *can* do, they seem truly magical, and appear to be able
to go way beyond the kinds of problems that they're actually capable of solving.
How do they do that?

Now we're going to spend some time thinking about how to **abstract** ideas and
information in such a way that computers can actually do something with them.
