Identify our existing course learning objectives
================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-01-31 Fri>

My first goal is to figure out what, exactly, we're teaching in current first
year courses. I've only taught 3/5 of these courses, and one of those was an
online version of the course that's probably really out of date.

This goal is really what I consider to be my minimal success criteria in
terms of our department gaining something from my work.

Identify course learning objectives for *other* institutions
============================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-02-21 Fri>

We've got our own internal, current goals for courses in the first year. What
do other institutions do? Domestic institutions? Different levels/kinds (high
school, college, university)? International? Having an idea of what's the
"best practice" in current introductory CS education might be helpful in
informing what we're doing internally.

Samples:

* <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science>
* [MIT 6.00{,01,02,SC}](outside/MIT 6.00{,01,02,SC}.md)
* USask CMPT 141
* Waterloo CS 115


Critically assess learning objectives
=====================================

DEADLINE: <2020-03-06 Fri>

Does what we're currently teaching in our first year computer science courses
make sense? Does it make sense in terms of...

- what other institutions are doing?
- what students know coming in to the program?

Can what we're currently teaching be improved? Focused?

Construct a new course, considering critical assessment
=======================================================

Create list of course objectives
--------------------------------

Create course learning outcomes
-------------------------------

Create course material for learning outcomes/objectives
-------------------------------------------------------

Create assignments
------------------

Create tests
------------

Create lab exercises
--------------------

Do we even *need*  lab exercises?
