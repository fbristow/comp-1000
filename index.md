Identify our existing course learning objectives
================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-01-31 Fri>

My first goal is to figure out what, exactly, we're teaching in current first
year courses. I've only taught 3/5 of these courses, and one of those was an
online version of the course that's probably really out of date.

This goal is really what I consider to be my minimal success criteria in
terms of our department gaining something from my work.

* [X] [COMP 1010](existing/COMP 1010.md)
* [X] [COMP 1020](existing/COMP 1020.md)
* [X] [COMP 1012](existing/COMP 1012.md)
* [X] [COMP 1500](existing/COMP 1500.md)
* ~~[COMP 1600](existing/COMP 1600.md)~~

Identify course learning objectives for *other* institutions
============================================================

DEADLINE: <2020-02-21 Fri>

We've got our own internal, current goals for courses in the first year. What
do other institutions do? Domestic institutions? Different levels/kinds (high
school, college, university)? International? Having an idea of what's the
"best practice" in current introductory CS education might be helpful in
informing what we're doing internally.

Samples:

* <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science>
* [MIT 6.00{,01,02,SC}](outside/MIT 6.00{,01,02,SC}.md)
* USask CMPT 141
* Waterloo CS 115


Critically assess learning objectives
=====================================

DEADLINE: <2020-03-31 Fri>

Does what we're currently teaching in our first year computer science courses
make sense? Does it make sense in terms of...

- what other institutions are doing?
- what students know coming in to the program?

Can what we're currently teaching be improved? Focused?

Rewording and revising existing learning objectives
---------------------------------------------------

The learning objectives and course outcomes that I gathered for COMP 1010 and
COMP 1020 were very stream-of-consciousness on my part. I want to revise these
learning objectives, and organize them by course outcome for each course.

* [X] [COMP 1020](reconsidered/COMP1020.md)

Critical assessment
-------------------

Based on what I can see, MIT leaps ahead of what we're doing very quickly. Given
the current state of things, requesting learning outcomes from other, more local
institutions isn't appropriate.

I think a more appropriate comparison is the ACM learning objectives for its
"Core-Tier 1" and "Core-Tier 2" lists of objectives in the [Curriculum
Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science][cs2013].

Construct a new course, considering critical assessment
=======================================================

Create list of course objectives
--------------------------------

Create course learning outcomes
-------------------------------

Create course material for learning outcomes/objectives
-------------------------------------------------------

Create assignments
------------------

Create tests
------------

Create lab exercises
--------------------

Do we even *need*  lab exercises?
