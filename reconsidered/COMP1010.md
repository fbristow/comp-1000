Before entering this course, a student should be able to:

* Evaluate arithmetic expressions, applying the rules of order of operation to
  basic arithmetic operators (&plus;, &minus;, &times;, &divide;).
* Use trigonometric functions to calculate angles.
* Download and install software on a computer.

Importantly: students are **not** expected to have any previous programming
experience.

Learning objectives
===================

Unit 1
------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run a simple,
  linear program using a procedural programming language. [program](#program)
    1. Use *literal values* in a program. :program:
    2. Describe what a program does using comments in code. :program:
  
IDE
: Software that simplifies writing software in a *specific* programming
language.

Examples of IDEs:

(@) [Processing] is an IDE for writing software in the Processing programming
language.
(@) [DrJava] is an IDE for writing software in the Java programming language.
(@) [Spyder] is an IDE for writing software in the Python programming language.
