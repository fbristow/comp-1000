Course prerequisites {-}
====================

Before entering this course, a student should be able to:

* Evaluate arithmetic expressions, applying the rules of order of operation to
  basic arithmetic operators (&plus;, &minus;, &times;, &divide;).
* Use trigonometric functions to calculate angles.
* Download and install software on a computer.

Importantly: students are **not** expected to have any previous programming
experience.

Learning objectives
===================

Programming Basics
------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run a simple,
  linear program using a procedural programming language. :program:
    1. Use *literal values* in a program.
    2. Describe what code does using *comments*.
  
IDE
: Software that simplifies writing software in a *specific* programming
language.

Examples of IDEs:

(@) [Processing] is an IDE for writing software in the Processing programming
language.
(@) [DrJava] is an IDE for writing software in the Java programming language.
(@) [Spyder] is an IDE for writing software in the Python programming language.

### Programming Basics: Processing

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Draw points, lines, and shapes on the Processing canvas. :program:
2. Change properties of shapes and the canvas, like background colour, outline
   colour, fill colour, size, and position. :program:

Variables and Integers
----------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Declare and use a variable in a program to represent information.  :program:
2. Initialize a variable using a literal value. :program:
3. Evaluate arithmetic expressions (&plus;, &minus;, &times;, &divide;, mod)
   that include both literal values and variables. :program: :evaluate:
4. Explain the purpose of the modulus operator. :communicate:
    1. List uses of the modulus operator.
5. Debug simple errors by inspecting the value of a variable as the program is
   running. :program:
   
Coding Style and Standards
--------------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Choose meaningful variable names that make code more readable. :program:
   :communicate:
2. Declare and use *named constants* in a program. :program:
3. Identify values that should be represented as a named constant. :program:
4. Explain how named constants can be used as a safety feature. :communicate:

Active Programs
---------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Use a "global variable" in a program to maintain state. :program:
2. Write a program that accepts and reacts to input from a user. :program:

### Active Programs: Processing

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Use the global variables exposed in the Processing environment as input to a
   program, like mouse position ([`mouseX`] and [`mouseY`]). :program:
2. Write a program that changes the canvas as time passes. :program:
3. List the special function names that are used in Processing. :communicate:
4. Order the function names by when they are executed when a Processing program
   is started. :communicate:
5. Explain the purpose of each of the special function names used in Processing.
   :communicate:
   
[`mouseX`]: https://processing.org/reference/mouseX.html
[`mouseY`]: https://processing.org/reference/mouseY.html

User-defined Functions, part 1
------------------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Create and use user-defined functions in a program. :program:
    1. Choose a concise and meaningful name for a user-defined function.
2. Trace the execution of code when user-defined functions are called.
   :evaluate:
3. Define the term "local variable". :communicate:
4. Determine the visibility of a variable declared in a program. :evaluate:
5. Define the term "scope" in terms of variable visibility when declared within
   a function. :communicate:
6. Compare and contrast local and global variables. :communicate:

Real Numbers - `float`s
-----------------------
