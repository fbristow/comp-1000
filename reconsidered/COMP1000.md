Course prerequisites {-}
====================

Before entering this course, a students should be able to:

* Evaluate arithmetic expressions, applying the rules of order of operation to
  basic arithmetic operators (&plus;, &minus;, &times;, &divide;).

Importantly: students are *not* expected to have any previous programming
experience.

Course outcomes {-}
===============

Part 1
------

By the end of part 1 of this course, a student should be able to:

1. Represent basic information and ideas abstractly, and digitally. :represent:
2. Use and evaluate computational ideas from first-principles (logic &rarr;
   circuits &rarr; processors & computers). :first-principles:
3. Implement abstractions as software (assembly language, visual language).
   :program:
4. Use and evaluate searching algorithms. :algorithms:
5. Gain a better understanding of computer science as a discipline. :concepts:

Part 2
------

By the end of part 2 of this course, a student should be able to:

1. Transfer programming skills to a new programming language. :program:
2. Use and implement data structures to represent complex information.
   :data-structures:
3. Write code that can handle failures gracefully. :exceptions:
4. Apply searching and sorting algorithms to collections, compare efficiency.
   :algorithms:
5. Formulate recursive solutions to problems and write recursive methods.
   :recursion:
