Learning objectives
===================

Course introduction, real Java
------------------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Write and run a program in a *new* programming language (Java), transferring
   skills learned in previous courses (Python or Processing). :program:
   
**Note**: In the current curriculum, this unit is 2 weeks long.

OOP Basics 1
------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Define the term "Object-oriented programming". :oo: :communicate:
    1. List the properties of a class.
    2. Explain what the `this` keyword represents in an instance method of a
       class.
    3. Define the term "encapsulation".
    4. Explain how and why the concept of encapsulation is useful.
    5. Explain how access modifiers (e.g., `public` and `private`) enable you to
       apply the principle of encapsulation.
2. Decide if an instance method or instance variable can be invoked or used in a
   specific scope given its access modifier. :oo: :evaluate:
3. Declare, initialize, and use instances of a *user-defined* class. :oo:
   :program:
    1. Write a "default constructor" for a class.
    2. Write and call instance methods for a class (e.g., `toString`,
       `compareTo`).
    3. Choose an appropriate access modifier for parts of a class (i.e., decide
       if data or code should be `public` or `private`).
    4. Decide if accessors and mutators are necessary for an instance variable
       (i.e., is the data part of the public interface of the class?). 
       
       
OOP Basics 2
------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Write a method to copy an instance of an object. :oo: :program:
    1. Decide when to use a shallow copy vs a deep copy.
2. Compare and contrast a "shallow copy" (i.e., use of assignment operator on a
   reference) vs "deep copy" (i.e., use of copy constructors or methods to copy
   object data). :oo: :communicate:
    1. Given a piece of code, draw a diagram that shows the state of references
       and copies as the code executes (passing-by-value vs
       passing-by-reference).
3. Explain what happens when an instance of an object has no references to it in
   Java (i.e., garbage collection). :oo: :communicate:
4. Compose a class from several other classes by declaring instance variables
   using other user-defined types (e.g., a `Person` has an `Address`). :design:
   :program:
5. Declare a class that refers to itself with instance variables (e.g., a
   `Person` has other `Person` attributes, like parents). :oo: :program:
6. Write and use a "list" class to represent a collection of values.
   :data-structures: :program:
7. Explain how using a "list" class can be better than using an array to
   represent collections of values. :data-structures: :communicate:
   
Multi-dimensional arrays
------------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Declare, initialize, and use multi-dimensional arrays in a Java program.
   :data-structures: :program:
    1. Declare, initialize, and use "ragged" arrays in a Java program (i.e.,
       multi-dimensional arrays with non-uniform length in the 2^nd^+
       dimension).
    2. Write a class that has a multi-dimensional array as an instance variable.
2. Given a piece of code, draw a diagram representing the state of references in
   a multi-dimensional array. :data-structures: :communicate:
3. Create "useful" instance methods for a class. [^useful-methods] :design:
   :program:
4. Write a simple, manual testing method for a class, in a separate file.
   :testing: :program:

[^useful-methods]: In the context of this course, a "useful" instance method is
one that provides matrix operations on a class that contains a multi-dimensional
array. I think the *intention* of this objective is that students be able to
generally lift reasonable operations on the object to its interface, but the
course only demonstrates this as writing operations on a matrix.

File I/O and exceptions
-----------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Create and use/`throw`/`catch` an `Exception` in a program. :exceptions: :program:
    1. Use built-in Java `Exception` types.
    2. Create user-defined `Exception` types.
2. Handle exceptions thrown (`try`/`catch`) by library code (specifically: I/O).
   :exceptions: :files: :program:
    1. Decide if an `Exception` should be handled in a `try`/`catch` block, or
       should be `throw`n by marking a method with `throws`.
    2. Handle *specific* `Exception`s thrown by an operation.
3. List the order of operations in a `try`/`catch`/`finally` block, given a
   piece of code. :exceptions: :evaluate:
4. Read and write text files in a program. :files: :program:
5. Parse the contents of a file by tokenizing strings in a program (e.g.,
   `String#split` or `Scanner`). :files: :program:
    1. Create an instance of a class based on the data that's contained within a
       file.
   
   
OOP Polymorphism 1
------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Create and use a subclass in a Java program. :oo: :program:
    1. Write one or more non-default constructors in a class hierarchy.
    2. Call the constructor or method in the parent class with the `super`
       keyword.
    3. Override the behaviour of a superclass in a subclass.
    4. Use the `protected` modifier to share data and behaviour between parent
       and subclass.
2. Explain how scoping rules apply to class hierarchies (e.g., parent and
   subclass share the same name on an instance variable). :oo: :communicate:
3. Given a class and subclass that have properties or behaviour with the same
   name (instance variables or method signatures), determine which property is
   being referred to in a specific scope. :oo: :evaluate:
4. Use implicit and explicit typecasting to broaden or narrow the type of a
   value. :oo: :program:
    1. Safely cast between types using the `instanceof` operator.
5. Define the term "polymorphism". :oo: :communicate:
    1. Explain how polymorphism is related to `abstract` classes in Java.
6. Write code that implements the concept of polymorphism in Java. :oo:
   :program:
    1. Write an `abstract` class in a Java program.

OOP Polymorphism 2 
------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Decompose a real-world domain into a model represented as a hierarchy of
   related classes. :oo: :design:
    1. Decide which class in a hierarchy of classes should have a property or
       behaviour.
2. Draw a diagram representing related classes in a hierarchy. :oo:
   :communicate:

Strings[^strings], ArrayLists
-------------------

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Create and use instances of the Java-specific `ArrayList` class.
   :data-structures: :program:
    1. Use the "generics" feature in Java to hint about the type stored in the
       collection.
    2. Use Java-specific wrapper classes for primitive types (i.e., `int` cannot
       be stored in a generic `ArrayList`, but `Integer` can).
2. Compare and contrast arrays and `ArrayList` (or, more generally, the `List`
   interface). :data-structures: :design: :communicate:
   
[^strings]: The only learning objective related to `String`s in this unit is to be
able to list/memorize and use *more* `String` methods.

1. Compare and contrast lists and arrays (e.g., insertion/deletion time, access
   time, contiguous memory allocation, size restrictions, etc).

   the best choice for data structure. :data-structures: :design:

2. Draw a diagram representing the state of a stack of method calls in a
   recursive function. :recursion: :communicate:

   :design: :program:
    1. Write a recursive solution to a problem with a "helper" function.

7. Describe sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort, selection sort, recursive
   merge sort, quick sort) in plain English. :algorithms: :communicate:
    1. Explain why choosing a poor pivot reduces the overall performance of the
       quick sort algorithm.
8. Write a program to implement sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort,
